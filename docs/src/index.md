# RandomMatrix.jl Documentation

A package for Random Matrix Theory.

The package currently is unregistered, you can only add it by
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/weiyang2048/RandomMatrix.jl")
```
I hope to add in enough functionalities and register it in Aug 2021.
If there is any functionality you want me to implement, please raise an issue.
